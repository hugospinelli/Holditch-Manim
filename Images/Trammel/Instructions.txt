The PNG files were removed because they were too big.
To generate them, open the Trammel.blend file in Blender and follow the steps:
1. Play the animation to check if everything is working.
2. Render the animation.
3. Delete the first frame ("0001.png").
4. Rename "0120.png" to "0000.png".
5. Rename "0121.png" to "0001.png".
